# Github Labels

Our labels we use troughout the github issue trackers of this organisation. 
Based on the blog post from [Robin Powered](https://robinpowered.com/blog/best-practice-system-for-organizing-and-tagging-github-issues/)

As management tool for our labels we use git-label-packages. 
More information about the tool can u find [here](https://medium.com/@dave_lunny/sane-github-labels-c5d2e6004b63).
